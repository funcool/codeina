= CodeÃ­na

A tool for generate beautiful api documentation for clojure and clojurescript.

This is a codox fork with various structural changes and new look.

== Quick Start

Include the following plugin in your project.clj file or your global profile:

[source,clojure]
----
:plugins [[funcool/codeina "0.5.0"
           :exclusions [org.clojure/clojure]]]
----

Put the initial configuration specifying to _codeina_ the location
of your sources and the language:

[source,clojure]
----
:codeina {:sources ["src"]
         :reader :clojure}
----

And run the `doc` lein subcommand:

[source,shell]
----
$ lein doc
Generated HTML docs in /path/to/you/project/doc
----

== Configuration

This is a complete example that uses all available options:

[source, clojure]
----
:codeina {:sources ["src"]
          :exclude [cats.monad.continuation
                    cats.monad.reader
                    cats.monad.writer]
          :reader :clojure
          :target "doc/dist/latest/api"
          :src-uri "http://github.com/funcool/cats/blob/master/"
          :src-uri-prefix "#L"}
----

And this is a detailed explanation of possible options:

* `:sources` ->  is a vector of paths that should be analized for extract the docstrings.
* `:reader` -> is a reader that should be used. Can be `:clojure` and `:clojurescript`.
* `:exclude` -> is a vector of namespace symbols that should be excluded.
* `:target` -> the directory when the documentation should be generated.
* `:src-uri` -> the base uri for the source code location.
* `:src-uri-prefix` -> additional uri prefix.


Additionally to that configuration options, the codeina interprets the metadata attached
to the code, then, you can granulary exclude some functions from the documentation
using `^:no-doc` metadata on the function or in entire namespace.

Also, you can use the `^:deprecated` metadata for mark visually in the documentation that
a function is deprecated.
